# bittensor $TAO




the first thing that stuck out to me when i first read the abut page i how bittensor has The ability to write a multiplicity of Bittensor incentive systems ( i think this means different ways to pay gas fees) and have them concurrently run within a single token ecosystem. to me that seems modular. i still don't understand how this is an AI coin. let me go ahead and send this from the page *Bittensor gives you all of it: an AI team, a storage team, a compute team, and anything else that can be dreamed of - all under a single token framework, turning TAO holders into effective Decentralized Cloud Providers, backed by an incentivized, adapting and ever-improving infrastructure. TAO is the bridge between clients and this mega-computer, plus the resources that are being created, through various subnetwork mechanisms, in Bittensor. This is the main functionality of TAO. Functionality, which hitherto was only within the reach of immense supercorps like OpenAI, is now accessible - in one non-permissioned place.* 


# my first thought?

BD THIS!!! haha but enough buzz words for me to ape on 2x

### CHECK THE CHAIN

The Blockchain layer is a layer-0 blockchain based on Polkadot Substrate man.... i am disinterested. not really i just know a lot of smart people hold dot. at the time i am forgettably  i overlook it. possible a lack of  decentralization in my eyes but i changed in the recent times. call me lazy, but im max bidding this. hoping i can play this super aggressive. i dont need to know how the ps5 works to play it.... run it. 



# continuing?
