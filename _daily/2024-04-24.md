# project Chartres 

overwhelming .... i found this https://github.com/Elenchev/order-book-heatmap/tree/main maybe i can bust it fown to rebuild 

# deep blue ocean 

i waisted months on this project. not saying the easiest route odd the best but i definitely should have tried the easier route first. my idea was too created my own from scratch. 500 code pilot promots i cashed for an open source boy that works great. all i need  now is to create a feed watcher for wallets or sites that donâ€™t use rss. 

#### major lesson 

get that shit working ASAP AS FAST AS POSIBBLE 

# WEB3Tv 

yo yo yo , man this feels good, a few more rss feeds and we are in there like swimwear. naw but really.
