wow what a crazy week. i atarted on sunday with $35 and somehow turned it into 1200. i was able to take that money a buy a fumo. i had always wanted one. now time to decide if i redeem. lately all my projects have been feeling overwhelming. Att that point i just start something new. i need to stop doing this. I am not really a master of anyrthing right now.. ahhh oh well. i trust the plan. i think the best things i can do right now is create an article for the blank exocore and then work on linea network airdrop guide.
