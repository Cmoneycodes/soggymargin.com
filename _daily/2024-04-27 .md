Today I worked on quite a lot. Unfortunately, I didn’t get much done. I learned a lot about Canada; they have a “slash” of 20ft of deforested land between the U.S. and Canada border. It costs every U.S. citizen 75 cents per year to maintain. Every 5-15 years, an agency deforests it. They also have odd Egyptian guidestones. COOL!

Politics-wise, I found this map. Quebec has always been more French and more left. They have been close to seceding from Canada multiple times.

I believe if my memory doesn’t mistake me, the War of 1812 was a United States-Canadian war. The U.S. lost, and we have been chill. I think less than 20% of Canadians speak French.

-- My Not Progress --

I had a super hard time creating the image file. I’m going to go on Fiverr to get this done.

Still adding RSS feeds. I'm not using any from my original list.

Looking to add web scraping features as well as message forwarding with filters, hyperliquid data, and finally an eventual wallet tracker. My idea for the wallet tracker is either paying for API access or scraping new it X or Etherscan. I have been getting super bothered that the nocturnal adjunct is not working. A comprehensive breakdown of the bot is well in order. I am positive the image overlay commands are broken, the kek command is broken, and possibly more. The money command did work, wiggle and the starting prompt. The random messages worked as well. Finally, on my telegram section, I think I will definitely separate the RSS reader and scraper. The reader is done by a pro. It's super confusing, which sounds ironic. Why can’t people just code on one file?

Timelines!!! 
- Docker fix: May 10
- Message forward: May 3
- Scraper: May 7

I really need to get this done so I can do efficient research. Today, when I was doing research, I learned founding U.S. documents are almost impossible to find. Somehow ended up on the Department of State website and found some anti-Russia pro-semitic content. I truly believe founding fathers are turning in their graves. What do I know? I might have found a published version, but it says edited. There are claims it’s headers and footnotes, but if that was the case for 90% of the pages, nobody would call the editor a liar for omitting 10%. I want all the letters. Here soon I have to overcome the hurdle of learning how to add PDFs to the site because I have recently been smashing books. Sometimes while talking to AI, I read half of “The Bond Book” but one night I saw I could upload it to GPT-4, and I felt like the learning curve was increased immensely.
