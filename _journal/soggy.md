# Remilio prayer 

God grant me  serenity,
Help me accept the things I cannot change.
The courage to change the things I can,
And the wisdom to know the difference.
Living one day at a time.
Enjoying one moment at a time.
Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace.
Taking,  this sinful world as it is,
Not as I would have it.
Trusting that You will make all things right,
If I surrender to Your will;
So that I may be reasonably happy in this life,
And supremely happy with You forever in the next.

AMEN
